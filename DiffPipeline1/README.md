# Pipeline 1

## Basics 

The basic (pre-"aligned data") dataset is denoted as BTRN, BTST
The basic "aligned data" dataset is denoted as BATRN, BATST

## Architecture

Trained on [Q from BATST, R from BATRN]
Testing on [Q from BATST, R from BATRN]

Using regular classification

## Research

When age radius is increasing, MAE is decreasing but this is saturating radius ~ 35
